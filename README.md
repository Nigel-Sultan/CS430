This application must be run in the format - application name, magic number, input file name, output file name (without commas).

Included is basic error checking and it does run with expected output.

Worked on this project with Johnny (Xiangzhi) for a few days so code may have similarities because we spent altogether more hours working with each other than can be counted on 2 hands.

Also used lots of code provided in class by the professor like my nested for loops for example and other stuff.

Code looks somewhat different from previous uploads because i had to scratch some stuff after running into errors with newline characters that I spent hours working on.

Also like to mention I did this without structs before realizing it was asked of us to use them so I had to adjust code. And my original buffer was just an array that I saved information to before actually allocating memory.
